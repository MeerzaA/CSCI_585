MEERZA AHMED CSCI 585 HW4 | README- 12/1/2023

I have no notes for this assignment, I feel my answers are pretty stright foward.

Q4: If my algorithm doesn't make sense look at the HW4_Q4.py file to see my logic for the algorithm, Its kinda similr to the code. 
Also look at the weights_Q4ab.png file to see my wights that I used in my handwritten algorithem.
